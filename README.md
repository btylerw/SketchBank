# Welcome to SketchBank!
## What SketchBank is
### SketchBank is **NOT** a real bank
#### This project is a simulated banking web app to be used to provide dummy financial data to use in other apps
#### SketchBank is built using React.js for the front-end, Node.js and Express.js for the back-end, and uses PostgreSQL for the database

### SketchBank is currently not completed, nor is it hosted publically as of yet
